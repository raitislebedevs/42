# Semanting Versioning

If we have version as 4.13.6 then we can reffer to them as Major.Minor.Patch.
Patch version is increased if a bug is increased.
Minor version is increased if the current API is not affected.
Major version is increased if any current API are affected.

Cases:
^4.13.6 means we are interested only in 4.x
~4.13.6 means we are interested only in 4.13.x versions
